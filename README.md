## About

This Python script is designed to export query results from Yearning, a database auditing platform, into an XLSX format file. The motivation behind creating this script stems from the limitations of Yearning's native export feature, which outputs results in CSV format that often leads to messy and inconvenient formatting issues.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies: Before running the script, make sure to install the necessary Python dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Navigate to the script's directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:
1. Open the browser and go to the Network tab in Developer Tools (usually activated by pressing F12).
2. Execute your query in Yearning and find the corresponding query request in the Network tab.
3. Copy the entire JSON response body (including the outermost curly braces) from the request's response.
4. Paste the JSON into a text file and save it.
5. In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the Python script is located.
6. Run the script using the following command, replacing `path_to_file.txt` with the path to your text file containing the JSON:
python main.py path_to_file.txt
For example, if your text file is named `test.txt` and is located in the same directory as the script, use the following command:
python main.py test.txt
The script will generate an XLSX file with the same name as the text file in the current directory.
